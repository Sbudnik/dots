# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for interactive shells.

# The copy in your home directory (~/.bashrc) is yours, please

# User dependent .bashrc file

# If not running interactively, don't do anything

# Shell Options
#
# See man bash for more options...
#
# Don't wait for job termination notification
#
# Don't use ^D to exit
#
# Make bash append rather than overwrite the history on disk
#
# When changing directory small typos can be ignored by bash
# for example, cd /vr/lgo/apaache would find /var/log/apache

# Completion options
#
# These completion tuning parameters change the default behavior of bash_completion:
#
# Define to access remotely checked-out files over passwordless ssh for CVS
#
# Define to avoid stripping description in --option=description of './configure --help'
#
# Define to avoid flattening internal contents of tar files
#
# Uncomment to turn on programmable completion enhancements.
# Any completions you add in ~/.bash_completion are sourced last.

# History Options
#
# Don't put duplicate lines in the history.
#
# Ignore some controlling instructions
# HISTIGNORE is a colon-delimited list of patterns which should be excluded.
# The '&' is a special pattern which suppresses duplicate entries.
#
# Whenever displaying the prompt, write the previous line to disk

# Aliases
#
# Some people use a different file for aliases

# Some example alias instructions
# If these are enabled they will be used instead of any instructions
# they may mask.  For example, alias rm='rm -i' will mask the rm
# application.  To override the alias instruction use a \ before, ie
# \rm will call the real rm not the alias.
#
# Interactive operation...
 alias rm='rm -i'
 alias cp='cp -i'
 alias mv='mv -i'
#
# Default to human readable figures
 alias df='df -h'
 alias du='du -h'
#
# Misc :)
 alias less='less -r'                          # raw control characters
 alias whence='type -a'                        # where, of a sort
 alias grep='grep --color'                     # show differences in colour
 alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'              # show differences in colour
 alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'              # show differences in colour
#
# Some shortcuts for different directory listings
 alias ls='ls -hF --color=tty'                 # classify files in colour
 alias dir='ls --color=auto --format=vertical'
 alias vdir='ls --color=auto --format=long'
 alias ll='ls -l'                              # long list
 alias la='ls -A'                              # all but . and ..
 alias l='ls -CF'                              #
alias up='cd ..'
